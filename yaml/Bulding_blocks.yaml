# Important building blocks of yaml

# 1) Sequences ---> similar to list and arrays
# block styles
- yaml
- github
- linux
- networking
---
# flow style
[yaml, github, linux, networking]

# 2) Mappings --> Similar to dictionaries, hasmaps
#                 Consists of Key: value pairs
#                 Valid key enteries ---> All types of scalars (must be unique within an mapping)
#                 Valid value enteries ----> All types of scalars, sequences, mapping,nested datatypes

# block style
Technologies: devops 
"My goal is": 60000000
1: "I like devops"
2.0: "Decimal entry"

# flow style
{Technologies: devops, 
"My goal is": 60000000,
1: "I like devops",
2.0: "Decimal entry"}

# 3) Scalars 
# NUMBERS
  # a.Intergers numbers -----> Whole numbers
number: 10
  # b.Binary numbers ----> 0's & 1's starts with 0b
Binary: 0b1010
  # c.Floating point numbers ---->  decimal numbers
floating: 10.00
  # d.Octal numbers ----> starts with 0
Octal: 010
  # e.Hexadecimal numbers ----> starts with 0x
hex: 0x90AB

# STRINGS
  # a. Simple String ---> escape sequences cannot be used
name: Venkata Naga Sai Harsha Nara
  # b. Single Quote String ---> Used when "" need to be used with an string
single-qoute: 'Venkata "Naga" Sai Harsha Nara'  
  # c. Double Qoute String ---> escape sequences can be used
double-quotes: "Venkata \"Naga\" \\Sai\\ \\nHarsha\\n Nara"

  # d. Single-line String ---> To avoide inbetween spaces

  # > --> all the inbetween line breaks are avoided, succesive line breaks are pratially avoided
name: >

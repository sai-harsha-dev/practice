DOCKER BASICS
--------------
- Docker is a containerization runtime which was invented by Docker.Inc
- At first it was single monolithic package, but now is set of microservices running together as a whole as Docker Engine
- Its main function is to create, maintain, delete containers.
- Initially there existed many runtimes which perfomed containerization in a different way
- The Open Container Initiative (OCI) regulated this by creating a common 
	a. Image specification
	b. Runtime specification
-Docker uses runc which is OCI complaint hence it can run on and orchestrator that uses OCI complaint runtime

DOCKER CLI 
--------------
- Responsible for parsing the commands from the user to the docker engine.
- It is interface where user interacts with the Docker engine.
- It is the layer which interacts with the Docker Engine through the endpoint REST API.

DOCKER ENGINE
-------------
- Docker Engine is the component responsible for creating, deleting, stoping, starting container.
- Docker Engine consists of 3 layer/ main sub modules.

  1. DOCKER DEAMON  ( BOTH IN LINUX & WINDOWS )
 ------------------
 - It is a background process.
 - It is the one which exposes the REST API endpoint.
 - It is responsible for :-
    a. Passing on the commands to containerD process
 - It is the one to which CLI interacts.

  2. ContainerD ( only for linux )
 ----------------
 - It is a CNCF project.
 - It is reponsible for :-
    a. Initializing shim process
    b. Passing on the commands to runc process
 - It maintains a account of all the container running by be connected with shim process associated with each container
  
  3. Shim &  runc (only for linux)
  ----------------
  - The containerd process calls up the shim which in turn runs the runc process.
  - runc is the one which is reposible for creating containers.
  - The runc process allocats namespaces and control groups by interacting with host OS.
  - runc terminated and forcks the container to shim process.
  - shim maitains the running container
  - runc is shortlived, shim is long lived.

- For windows the containerd and runc are maintained by a compute service process.

CLOUD COMPUTING
----------------
USES
-----
 1. ELASTIC
 -----------
  - Meaning that resources are more scalable compared to private infrastructure.
  - This is because of the fact that there are many abundent resources and cloud providers can provision resource on demand.
  - In private data centers its not the case since servers are bought on demand.

 2. RELIABLE
 ------------
  - Cloud providers provide higher uptime (as per Service level agreement).
  - They have very robust  infrastructure since they are maintained by market leading cloud providers.
 
 3. LOWER ECONOMICS OF SCALE
 ----------------------------
  - Since its a consumption based model where everyone uses the same infrastructure.
  - So the cost baring is spread to all the consumers and not an individual company.

 4. LOWER CAPEX HIGHER OPEX
 ---------------------------
  - Capital expenditure is low since the upfront cost is low.
  - Operational expenditure is where all the capital is spent on hence ROI is high.


CLOUD SERVICES
---------------
 1. IAAS
 -------
  - Infrastructure as Service.
  - CLOUD PROVIDER ====> Bare metal servers are provisioned as per need.
  - USERS ====> application, OS , patching, middleware, data.
  - CONTROL ====> Full user control.
  - Eg :- VM's

 2. PAAS
 --------
  - Platform as a Service
  - CLOUD PROVIDER ====> OS, patching,middleware, hardware
  - USERS ====> Application, data.
  - CONTROL ====> Partial user control
  
 3. SAAS
 --------
  - Software as a service
  - CLOUD PROVIDER ====> OS, patching,middleware, hardware, Application, data.
  - USERS ====> Nothing
  - CONTROL ====> Full service provider control.
  - Eg :- Microsoft 365


CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS
------------------------
 1. PUBLIC CLOUD  ---> All infra maintained in publically shared cloud resources.
 2. PRIVATE CLOUD ---> All infra maintained in restricted access cloud or on-premise recources.
 3. COMMUNITY CLOUD ---> All infra maintained in isolated sections of publoc cloud with no public access.( used by government agencies )

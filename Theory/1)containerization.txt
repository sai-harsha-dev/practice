VIRTUALIZATION (HARDWARE VIRTUALIZATION)
---------------
- Virtualization solved the problem of hardware wastage
- Virtualization was capable of partisioning the hardware resources but needed individual OS for each VM
- Virtualized VM's are heavy and they take time to boot up and occupy lot of system resources.
- Virtualized VM's needed additional software packages (dependencies) to be instatlled in top of OS to run software

CONTANERIZATION (OS VIRTUALIZATION)
----------------
- Containirization was capable of virtualizing the Host OS itself.
- Containerized Applications (Containers) were more light weight since they need worked on top of Host OS itself.
- Containers package all the software dependencies meaning that a containerized app can run in can compatible OS platform
- Linux based containers run only on Linux & Windows based containers run only on windows

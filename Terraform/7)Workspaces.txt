- Workspaces are used to spin up multiple environments(dev,test,  prod) of the same config.
- By default the terraform creates a default workspace which cannot be deleted.

- ADVANTAGES
  -----------
  - No need to maintain different config for each environments.
  - Re-usability

- WORKING
  -------
  - Terraform creates seperate directories under terraform.tflock directory
    and maintains the STATE DATA for each Workspaces seperately.

  - Updates are done to that specific state data during every deployment.

  - terraform.workspace can be used access the workspace under use.


- STORING STATE DATA & VARIABLES CONFIG FILES IN REMOTE 
--------------------------------------------------------
  - This is supported by terraform.
  - Just update the backend configuration in terraform block and 
    create seperate directories for each workspace.
  - Use the terraform.workspace refernce to reference the state data and config being used.

a. VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD
-------------------------
 - This is aws service which facilitates creation of networks in the cloud.
 
 - PROPERTIES
  -----------------
    1. CIDR RANGE
    -------------
    - Refer to the ip range given to be used by resources (not only vm's) in the network. 
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.

    2. SUBNET
    ---------
    - Refer to segementation of specific ip address range within virtual networks.
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.
    - Always 5 ip are used to by azure (first 4 and last 1).
    - Each subnet must be always in a specific Availability zone.
    - By default AWS creates subnets for all Availability zones of VPC region.
    
    3. SCOPE
    --------
    - The VPC is available all across the region.
    - By default AWS creates VPC for all regions in AWS.
    
    4. CONNECTIVITY
    ----------------
    - 1. INTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Within the same vpc)
      ------------------------
      - Resource within the same network, and subnets under that network can
        communicate with each other (only if port opened in Security group, routes
        specified in the route table)
      - Traffic flows within the AWS backbone network.

    - 2. INTERVPC CONNECTIVITY (Between 2 different vpc's)
      -------------------------
      - Done using vpc peering.
      - Traffic flows within the AWS backbone network.
      - Cannot handle intermediate transit(huge data flow), only used to instance to instance conectivity.
      - To create vpc peering the admin has to accept from the other VPC 

    - 3. EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Networks outside AWS)
      -------------------------
      - Done with help of 
        a. Internet gateway ===> To allow connection to internet ( Needs Elastic IP )
        b. VPN gateway ===> To connect a on prem network, other cloud network (Can use private IP)


b. NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL LIST

    b. RULES
    ---------
    - By default allows :-
      a. INBOUNDS TRAFFIC ===> only from within VPC.
      b. OUTBOUND TRAFFIC ===> All traffic
    - Ports filtering  ====> Allow traffic through specific ports
    - Protocols filtering ===> Allow traffic to the specific portocols
    - Destination filtering ===> Specfic Ip, Service Ip, All 

    c. STATEFULL

- Compute service provide compute workload.

- There two types cloud offering for compute services in AWS.
 
   1. IAAS 
   --------
   - These are compute service which provide full configuration access to user.
   - The service offering under this tear in aws is :-
     
     EC2
     ----
     - This is virtual machine running the cloud.

     - CHARACTERISTICS
      ---------------
      a. OS  ===> User configured
      b. DISKS ===> User configured (By default provides instance volumes(non presistant), 
                                     for peristant use EBS volume( must in the same availability zone as EC2))
      c. NETWORKS ===> User configured (by default aws creates a default VPC, Subnet, Public)
      d. RUNTIME ===> User configured
      e. APPLICATION & DATA ===> User configured

     - TYPES
     --------
      a. GENERIC
      b. COMPUTE OPTIMISED
      c. MEMORY OPTIMISED (used for in memory databases)
      d. STORAGE OPTIMISED (used for high IO speeds)
      e. SPECIAL (GPU for ai,ml tasks)

     - PAYMENT MODEL
      ---------------
      - AWS offers different payment models for the EC2 instances:-
        1. ON-DEMAND
        -------------
         - This is the payment in which is done as per the rate on the spot.
         - Offers no savings
         - Useful for workloads such as testing which dont run for long predetermined amount of time.

        2. RESERVED
        ------------
         - This is plan where in the user can reserve an amount of compute instance for a lower prize upfront
         - These are used for instances where the workload will run for long predetermined amount of time.
        
         - VM TYPES
           ---------
           1. STANDARD     ===> The VM type cannot be changed after reservation
           2. CONVERTABLE  ===> The VM type can be changed after reservation
           3. SCHEDULED    ===> The VM can be used at scheduled time frames
         
        - PAYMENT TYPES
          -------------
           1. UPFRONT (most savings)     ===> Total cost payment done upfront
           2. PARTIAL                    ===> Partial sum of the total cost is made upfront
           3. NO-UPFRONT (least savings) ===> Payment made after the reservation period
     

        3. DEDICATED
        ------------
         - This used incases where in the company need the whole server unit and not just instance.

        4. SAVINGS
        ----------
         - Similar to reserved but compute capacity cannot be reserved.
         - Applies for Lamda,AWS beanstack

        5. SPOT
        -------
         - Offers un-used compute instances at a lower rate.
         - Cannot gaurentee the presence of an instance (notified before 2mins of decommisiong)
         - Used for workload that need not run continuosly (batch jobs)

  
   2. PAAS
   --------
   - These are offering where the user doesn't manage all of the configuration.
   - Useful when control is not need but scalability, availability is need.
 
   - SERVICES
   -----------
   1. ELASTIC BEANSTACK
   ---------------------
   - This is used to run web application.
   - User can choose the runtime and deploy the code/container.
   - AWS handles provisioning, scaling of the service.

   - CHARACTERISTICS
      ---------------
      a. OS  ===> Service provider (User can choose the, service provider takes care of updates and patching)
      b. DISKS ===> Service provider 
      c. NETWORKS ===> Service provider (user can choose the VNET to be used) 
      d. RUNTIME ===> Service provider (User can choose the, service provider takes care of updates and patching)
      e. APPLICATION & DATA ===> User configured

    - FEATURES
      ---------
      a. CONTROL ===> User on maintains application and data.
      b. SCALABILITY ===> Autoscaling 
      c. DISASTER RECOVERY ===> Based on service plans   
      d. HIGH AVAILABILITY ===> Highly available 


   2. AWS LAMBDA
   --------------
    - Used to run pieces of code based on triggers.
    - trigger types 
      a. TIMER
      b. HTTP REQUEST
      c. EVENT FROM AZURE RESOURCE

    - CHARACTERISTICS
      ---------------
      a. OS  ===> Service provider ( user can choose linux or windows )
      b. DISKS ===> Service provider
      c. NETWORKS ===> Service provider (user can choose the VNET) 
      d. RUNTIME ===> Service provider
      e. APPLICATION & DATA ===> User configured

    - FEATURES
      ---------
      a. CONTROL ===> Service provider full control.
      b. SCALABILITY ===> autoscaling.
      c. DISASTER RECOVERY ===> Yes 
      d. HIGH AVAILABILITY ===> Yes

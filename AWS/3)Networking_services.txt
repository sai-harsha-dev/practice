This are AWS offerings which provide newtorking capabilities in the cloud.

a. VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD
-------------------------
 - This is aws service which facilitates creation of networks in the cloud.
 
 - PROPERTIES
  -----------------
    1. CIDR RANGE
    -------------
    - Refer to the ip range given to be used by resources (not only vm's) in the network. 
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.
    - Always 5 ip are used to by aws (first 4 and last 1).
    - Single vpc can contain mutiple CIDR ranges

    2. SUBNET
    ---------
    - Refer to segementation of specific ip address range within virtual networks.
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.
    - Always 5 ip are used to by azure (first 4 and last 1).
    - Each subnet must be always in a specific Availability zone
    
    3. SCOPE
    --------
    - The VPC is available all across the region.

    4. CONNECTIVITY
    ----------------
    - 1. INTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Within the same vnet)
      ------------------------
      - Resource within the same network, and subnets under that network can
        communicate with each other (only if port opened in Security group, routes
        specified in the route table)
      - Traffic flows within the Azure backbone network.

    - 2. INTERVPC CONNECTIVITY (Between 2 different vpc's)
      -------------------------
      - Done using vpc peering.
      - Traffic flows within the AWS backbone network.
      - Cannot handle intermediate transit, only used to instance to instance conectivity.
      - To create vpc peering the admin has to accept from the other VPC 

    - 3. EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Networks outside AWS)
      -------------------------
      - Done with help of 
        a. Internet gateway ===> To allow connection to internet ( Needs Elastic IP )
        b. VPN gateway ===> To connect a on prem network, other clud network 


b. SECURITY GROUP
------------------
 - Is used to configure the Inbound/ Outbound port access.
 - Can be created while creating EC2 or can be create seperately and connected to ENI of EC2 instance.

 - PROPERTIES
    -----------
    a. SCOPE
    --------
    - Applied to subnet level.
    - Needs to be connected to the Elastic Network Interface of an instance.

    b. RULES
    ---------
    - Ports filtering  ====> Allow traffic through specific ports
    - Protocols filtering ===> Allow traffic to the specific portocols
    - Destination filtering ===> Specfic Ip, Service Ip, All 
    


c. ELASTIC NETWORK INTERFACE
-----------------------------
 - It performs the work done by NIC cards in the cloud.
 - Single ENI can connect to multiple SECURITY GROUPS.
 - PROPERTIES
   -----------
   IP ADDRESS
   -----------
   - The private Ip and Public IP ( Elatic IP ) of the EC2 instance should be specified here.
   SCOPE
   --------
   - Applied to subnet level.


d. ROUTE TABLE / IMPLICIT ROUTER
--------------------------------
 - Used to defined custom routes for traffic flow
 - PROPERTIES
  -----------
   SCOPE
   --------
   - Applied to VPC.
   - A VPC can have multiple route tables.


e. AWS LOAD BALANCER
--------------------
  - Used to club multiple EC2/Azure resources within a single public ip and expose to the public internet.
  - Provides HA and loadbalacing to different resources
  - TYPES
    ------
    1. NETWORK LOAD BALANCER ===> layer 7 loadbalancing
    2. APPLICATION LOAD BALANER ===> layer 4 loadbalancing ( advanced features )
    3. ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER ===> Classic AWS load balancer


f. INTERNET GATEWAY
--------------------
 - Used to provide internet access to the resources in a VPC.
 - Unlike azure where public access is default, aws provides public access through IGW only.
 - PROPERTIES
   -----------
   HIGH AVAILABILITY
   --------------------
   - AWS maintains multiple copies.
 
   SCOPE
   ------
   - Resides at VPC level.
  
   WORKING MECHANISM
   ------------------
   - NAT the CIDR IP with the Elastic IP.
 

g. VPN
--------
- There are 2 types of offering available 

 1.VPN GATEWAY
 -------------
 - Used to connect onprem, other cloud network to VPC in cloud.
 - PROPERTIES
   -----------
   HIGH AVAILABILITY
   --------------------
   - AWS maintains multiple copies.

   SCOPE
   ------
   - Resides at VPC level.
  
   WORKING MECHANISM
   ------------------
   - Tunnels the traffic in encrypted format through the public internet.

 
 2. DIRECT CONNECT
 -----------------
 - Used to directly connect on prem network through physical cables to the AWS backbone network.
 - Can be done by directly connecting to AWS EDGE loactions or Through AWS PARTNER NETWORKS.


h. API GATEWAY
---------------
  - Used to provide API endpoint to application.

i. ROUTE 53
------------
  - Its a highely available DNS registration/DNS server service.

j. CDN
-------
  - These are globla POP(point of propogation) available all over the world.
  - Usually used to provide low lantency static connenct delivery.
  - Makes use of the AWS edge locations.

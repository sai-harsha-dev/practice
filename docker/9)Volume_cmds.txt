THEORY
------
- Volumes are used to create persistant storage ( useful when a service is spread across containers and need to data stored (statefull))
- They are only created in a specific host not across swarm
- To create a swarm spread volume make an NFS store and create an volume

COMMANDS
---------
docker volume create <volume name> ===> create a volume in that host alone

docker volume ls ==> list available volumes 

docker container --mount storage=<volume name>, target=<which directory of container to mount the volume> ====> to mount a volume to a container

docker volume inspect <volumenmae> ===> get details of the volume

docker volume rm <volumename> ===> to delete the volume (remember to delete the linked container before deleting the volume)

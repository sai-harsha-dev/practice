docker network create -d <bridge/overlay/macvlan/ipvlan> <networkname> --ip-range <ip address/subnet mask> --sunbet <ip range/subnetmask>  ===> to create a network
  :-- a overlay network get replicated all over the swarm and needs swarm mode enabled
      port mapping for a overlay network get replicated in all the nodes in the swarn

docker network connect <networkname> <container/service> ====> to connect container/service to a existing network

docker network disconnect <networkname> <container/service> ===> to disconnect container/service from exisiting network

docker <container/service> --network <network name> ===> to connect service/container to network

docker network ls ==> list the available networks

docker network inspect <networkname> ===> to see the details(ipaddrs, linked containers) of available networks

docker network rm <networkname> ===> to delete the network

(for bridge or for overlay for the containers to talk to outerworld they need a port mapping to the host machine)

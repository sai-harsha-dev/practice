- These are service which provide networking capabilities in azure.
- All of these service come under PAAS.
- The major services are :-
  
  a. AZURE VIRTUAL NETWORK
  ------------------------
  - Similar to private networks in physical environment
  - Used to place resources in a particular network or virtual network in cloud.
  - PROPERTIES
    -----------------
    1. CIDR RANGE
    -------------
    - Refer to the ip range given to be used by resources (not only vm's) in the network. 
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.
    - Always 5 ip are used to by azure.

    2. SUBNET
    ---------
    - Refer to segementation of specific ip address range within virtual networks.
    - Notation <1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>.<1-255>/subnet mask.
    - Always 5 ip are used to by azure.
    
    3. SCOPE
    --------
    - Associated with a single resource groups.

    4. CONNECTIVITY
    ----------------
    - 1. INTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Within the same vnet)
      ------------------------
      - Resource within the same network, 
        and subnets under that network can communicate with each other (only if port opened for VM)
      - Traffic flows within the Azure backbone network.

    - 2. INTERVNET CONNECTIVITY (Between 2 different vnets)
      -------------------------
      - Done using vnet peering.
      - Traffic flows within the Azure backbone network. 

    - 3. EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY (Networks outside Azure)
      -------------------------
      - Done with help of VPN gateway, Application gateway.
 

  b. NETWORK SECURITY GROUP
  -------------------------
  - Used to applying inbound & outbound traffic rules at different level.(not firewall)
  - PROPERTIES
    -----------
    a. SCOPE
    --------
    - By default its created with the virtual network interface of VM
    - Can be applied either to subnet level.

    b. RULES
    ---------
    - Ports filtering  ====> Allow traffic through specific ports
    - Protocols filtering ===> Allow traffic to the specific portocols
    - Priority ====> Lower priority rules are given precedence over higher priority rules.


  c. APPLICATION SECURITY GROUP
  -----------------------------
  - Gives more granual level inbound & outbound traffic rules at individual resource level.
  - WORKING
    -------
    - APPLICATION SECURITY GROUP resource are created and associated with a resource.
    - APPLICATION SECURITY GROUP are associated with the a NSG rule.

  d. VPN GATEWAY
  ---------------
  - Provide connectivity among private external networks and VNET in azure.
  - WORKING
    -------
    - Azure create seperate VM's acting a VPN server in a seperate subnet with the VNET.
    - Provides a public IP for VPN server which other network devices can access
    - External traffic is routed through a encrypted tunnel to the VPN server via internet
    - VPN servers route the traffic to the VNET.
  
  - TRAFFIC FLOW
    ------------
    a. SERVICE---EXTERNAL  ====> defined through route table (user defined routes)
    b. EXTERNAL---SERVICES ====> VPN encryted tunnel

  - TYPES
    ------
    1. SITE-TO-SITE VPN
    --------------------
    - Connects a whole private network/ multiple networks via VPN to the VPN gateway.
    - Used to connect individual office networks to the VNET
    - Traffic is sent throught the encrypted tunnel in the public internet

    2. SITE-TO-POINT VPN
    --------------------
    - Connects individual computers via VPN to the VPN gateway.
    - Used to connect individual PC's to the VNET
    - Traffic is sent throught the encrypted tunnel in the public internet

    3. EXPRESS ROUTE
    ----------------
    - Used to create private network connection to the resources in VNET.
    - Different bandwidths and different plans(up front(unlimited egress traffic), pay as go) possible.
    - WORKING
      -------
      - Private lanes lied down directly or through Service providers to microsoft END networks.
      - Traffic goes throught the dedicated lanes to the Azure backbone network.

  e. LOAD BALANCER
  ----------------
  - Provides layer7 load balancing.
  - Used to club multiple VM's/Azure resources within a single public ip and expose to the public internet.
  - Provides HA and loadbalacing to different resources

  f. APPLICATION GATEWAY
  ----------------------
  - Similar to Load balancer but provides additional features.
  - Its more specific to HTTP traffic.

  - WORKING
    -------
    - Azure create seperate VM's acting a APPLICATION GATEWAY in a seperate subnet within the VNET.
    - Provides a public IP for APPLICATION GATEWAY  which other network devices can access
    - APPLICATION GATEWAY route the traffic to the VNET.

  - TRAFFIC FLOW
    ------------
    a. SERVICE---EXTERNAL  ====> defined through route table (user defined routes)
    b. EXTERNAL---SERVICES ====> VPN encryted tunnel

  - ADDITIONAL FEATURES
    --------------------
    - LAYER 7 LOAD BALANCING
    - CUSTOM ROUTING

  g. AZURE FIREWALL
  ------------------
  - Function a point of interface between external traffic and service within a VNET.

  - WORKING
    -------
    - Azure create seperate VM's acting a  AZURE FIREWALL in a seperate subnet within the VNET.
    - Provides a public IP for  AZURE FIREWALL  which other network devices can access
    - AZURE FIREWALL route the traffic to the VNET.  

  - TRAFFIC FLOW
    ------------
    a. SERVICE---EXTERNAL  ====> defined through route table (user defined routes)
    b. EXTERNAL---SERVICES ====> VPN encryted tunnel

  - ADDITIONAL FEATURES
    --------------------
    - LAYER 7 LOAD BALANCING
    - NAT rules.
    - URL based routing.
 
  h. AZURE DNS
  -------------
  - This is Domain registering (done via Godaddy) and DNS server provisioning service provided in AZURE.
  - Can do both Domain registering and DNS server provisioning or DNS server provisioning.
  - By default Azure provides DNS enteries to resource in its own domains(.azurewebsies.net etc..) for public access via URL.
  - If custom domains needed they can be register and exposed in DNS server created in Azure.
  - Also provide private DNS service for just internal use.

  i. CONTANT DELIVERY NETWORKS
  ----------------------------
  - Similar to azure app service, but exposes the resources across geographies.
  - Improves the access time to App service resources.

  j. PRIVATE ENDPOINTS
  ---------------------
  - Used to revoke the public IP access to a resource.
  - Makes the resource a part of the VNET with private ip with CIDR range.
  - Restricts public access to a resource.

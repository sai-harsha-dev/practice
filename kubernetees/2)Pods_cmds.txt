THEORY
----------
- Pods are the atomic units in Kubernetees cluster ( same as containers in docker )
- Each node in the cluster runs multiple pods.
- Each pod uses a fixed amount of resource (CPU,RAM, storage) of a node.
- Each pod can run single or mutiple containers.
- Pods are stateless and shortlived.

PODS SPECIFICATIONS
-------------------
- IP ADDRESS ===> SINGLE IP PER POD
- INTERNAL ACCESS ===> INTERNAL ACCESS ONLY WITHIN THE CLUSTER AND SAME NETWORK
- EXTERNAL ACCESS ===> THROUGH SERVICE OBJECT

PROCESS OF PODS CREATIONS
-------------------------

     1. CREATE THE IMAGE FOR THE APP AND PUBLISH IT IN A REGISTRY (PRIVATE OR PUBLIC)
                                            | 
                                            |
2. Create an yaml file consiting of pod configuration instruction(such as path to image, pods name etc..)
                                            |
                                            |
              3. Give commands in kubectl to use the yaml file and create pods
                                            |
                                            |
                              4. API SERVER CREATES PODS.
                                            |                              
                                            |
                               5. SCHEDULER DEPLOYS PODS


COMMANDS
--------
1) kubectl apply -f <path of the configuration yaml file>  ==> to create pod

(* to create poda with multiple containers, create two container in yaml file attributes)

2) kubectl get pods --watch ===> to get information about all the pods in cluster

3) kubectl get pods -o wide ===> gives IP, Labels of all the pod in cluster

4) kubectl describe pods <pod name> ====> gives detailed information of the specific pod in cluster
